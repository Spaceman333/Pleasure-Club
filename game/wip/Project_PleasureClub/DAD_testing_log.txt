Body Dimensions -> genitals -> vaginaSize - seems to do nothing

Body Modifiers -> Miscellaneous -> sub - no idea what this is, wish the mouse hover tooltip could tell me

Create Character -> "Load From Code" - the function works itself, but after loading a character from code, I cannot edit them. The sliders do not seem to update with the loaded character and any changes do not alter the character.
