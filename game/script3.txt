    "The reviews for it are curiously mixed, since it seems like the negative ones are only from the ones that were denied entry."
    "Only a few neutral reviews stated that it wasn't for them despite trying and enjoying some of it, but felt it was too much for them to handle."
    "Aside from that its being praised a lot and people are loving it."
    "Oddly enough though, no one goes into the details and is adamant to keep the surprise a secret intentionally, recommending people to see it for themselves."
    "The club has been operating for a few months and despite quietly popping on to the scene without much hype, it has managed to thrive so far."

    "Some feared it would bring upon the end of civilization, but to everyones surprise it didn't."
    "Unions were set up and the businesses that opened up have been professional. Its all clean, tested and safe."
    "It has turned out to be quite mundane actually, with sex services these days being not that different from a visit to a spa or a massage."
    "Some have even compared it to a common visit to a hairdresser."
    "After all, human beings have a need for love and a need for sex the same way as we have a need for food; once satisfied, we go do something else until we feel hungry for it again."
    "When something happens as often as a lunch does, it stops being such a big deal. You just do it and don't think of it intently once you had it."
    "Nowadays sex work is just a service and business like any other. Its odd how quickly things can change."

By being honest, they're let in anyway but noted that if they haven't yet reached basic biological sexual maturity, then none of this will make sense to them.

g “If you want a hint where to start, just
try any of the corners of this lounge.
There are a number of ladies available
for some fun.”
g “Oh and occasionally we may also
get new ladies to join our group, so be
sure to come again in the future.”
That last line, she says with a glint in
her eye and a wide smile, looking you
deep in the eyes.
You are taken a back by this gesture,
but compose yourself once again. Its
probably just another part of the
experience.
You thank her for the information and
step forward into the lounge.

You are considering what to do next.
Standing in the lounge, you can see
different spots where various ladies are
lounging.
Some of them glance your way,
expectingly. Occasionally they wink and
beckon at you.
Others softly flutter their eyes towards
you, while some stare with mild
predatory intimidation.
Seems like theres a lot of variety to be
had for sure.
None of them are too similar to another.
They all seem to have a personality of
their own.
Strangely, you do not see any other
customers around, despite being sure
you saw some go in and come out of
here.
Looking up you see some signs that
indicate places where you can go.
Apparently you can freely go anywhere.
Anna is still here and is ready for any
questions you may have.

label anna_questions:
Q Can you tell me about the areas?
A Sure. The Lounges here is the starting
point and has a general palette of common
kinks.
In the Dressing Rooms, you may find more
of things involved with femdom, role
reversal, crossdressing and other fun things.
The Bedrooms is where usually more
passionate and fierce things happen.
The Courtyard features more alternative and
special experiences. If its exotic you’re
looking for, you might find something excited
there.
Then again, each of these places are not
strictly locked to a theme. Its all mixed and
shuffled.
You’ll never know what you’ll be getting
yourself into until you interact with each lady
a bit deeper.
Some ladies may offer the opposite of what
the place usually offers, so ultimately each
lady is a surprise of their own.
Also some ladies may have you change
locations during a fun session, so even then
you never know where you’ll eventually end
up.
Usually you’ll be able to get a gist of what it’ll
be based on your initial introduction with
them, but they may not reveal everything
right away.
Finding out is part of the fun, but we promise
you’ll have a good time nonetheless with
any of them, she reassures you with a
genuine smile.
If at any point you feel like something is not
your thing, don’t hesitate to back off. No one
will be upset or get mad if you do. Everyone
has their subjective tastes and we respect
your freedom to choose.
Thought some ladies might challenge you and not give you up so easily, but thats also part of the fun, she grins at you with a suggestive look.
